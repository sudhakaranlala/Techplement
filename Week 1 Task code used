Commands used in this Project:
1. Connect to EC2 Instance via SSH:
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-instance-ip
This command establishes an SSH connection to your EC2 instance using your private
key (your-key.pem) and the instance's public IP address (your-instance-ip).
2. Update Package Index:
sudo apt update
This command updates the package index on your EC2 instance, ensuring that you have
access to the latest versions of packages.
3. Install Required Packages:
sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
This command installs Apache web server, MySQL database server, PHP, and necessary
PHP modules to run WordPress on your EC2 instance.
4. Download WordPress:
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
This command downloads the latest version of WordPress in a .tar.gz archive format to your
EC2 instance.
5. Extract WordPress Files:
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
This command extracts the WordPress files from the downloaded archive.
6. Move WordPress Files to Apache Document Root:
sudo mv wordpress/* /var/www/html/
This command moves the extracted WordPress files to the Apache document root directory,
which is where your website files are served from.
7. Create MySQL Database and User for WordPress:
sudo mysql -u root -p
This command logs into the MySQL shell using the root user.
SQL
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wordpressuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wordpressuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
These SQL commands create a MySQL database named wordpress, create a MySQL user
named wordpressuser with the password password, grant all privileges on the wordpress
database to the wordpressuser, and then flush privileges to apply the changes.
8. Configure WordPress:
sudo cp /var/www/html/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php
sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php
The first command copies the WordPress sample configuration file to a new file named
wp-config.php.The second command opens the wp-config.php file in the Nano text editor,
allowing you to edit it.
In the wp-config.php file, you'll need to update the database connection settings with the
database name, username, password, and host.
These commands are the fundamental steps involved in setting up WordPress and MySQL
on an AWS EC2 instance. Adjustments may be needed depending on your specific setup or
requirements.
